<p>Reinforcement learning is the study of sequential decision making, with the ‚Äúsimple‚Äù objective of maximising long-term reward. In this talk I will introduce the two main approaches to solving reinforcement learning, evaluating their pros and cons. To finish, I will introduce upside down reinforcement learning, which may provide a simplified approach to tackling many traditional reinforcement learning problems.</p>
